// Attention: derive operator-visible notices from durable state. Pure
// functions over storage-shaped inputs so the same computation backs both
// `durig status` (one-shot) and the `durig watch` stream, and so the
// proving test can drive it without a live model.
//
// Blocked means one of two things an operator must hear about:
// - "idle_with_queued_work": work is addressed to the seat but nothing of
//   theirs is in flight and their last run settled — nobody will pick it
//   up until something wakes the seat.
// - "last_run_failed": the seat's most recent run ended unanswered (crash,
//   abort, provider error). The reason travels with the notice.

 * Every notice carries a `scope`, added alongside `seat` rather than replacing
 * it (additive, so an existing reader keying on `seat` keeps working). Seat
 * notices are `scope:"seat"`; the metrics layer contributes rig- and
 * queue-scoped notices with a null seat, and a per-seat renderer must exclude
 * those EXPLICITLY - filtering on the seat field alone would put a rig-wide
 * notice on whichever seat row happened to match.
