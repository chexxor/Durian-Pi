# durig — roadmap

Ordered by operator value; each item names its motivating finding.
State as of **2026-10-10**: work is paused at the end of the viewing/formatting
milestone. `docs/STATUS.md` is the handoff record; `docs/DECISIONS.md` holds the
reasoning, and D23 records how this roadmap was re-ordered by the research.

## Milestones

- **M1 — Rig runs and routes. ✅ done.** Queue semantics, org edges, Router at
  harness open, seat prompts, real-model e2e (D3, D4, D5, D16).
- **M2 — Operator can see the rig. ✅ done.** `watch`/`log` human views, live
  stream on `send`, turn-grouped transcripts with timestamps, wrong-database
  guardrail (D18, D19, D20).
- **M3 — Seats can do work, and the rig verifies it. ⏳ next.** Two things that
  are one work item (D23): seats hold only the four queue tools, so they cannot
  read a corpus or run a check; and `complete_work` is self-declared, with no
  evidence attached and no verifier step. A verification the rig cannot run is a
  promise, not a check.
- **M4 — Interactive client over the same store.** Deferred by decision (D21),
  not by accident. Blocked on choosing TUI vs browser, which needs an operator
  ruling.

## Gap analysis vs the research (2026-10-10)

Failure modes named by the MAST taxonomy, Anthropic's production and swarm
research, and the practitioner consensus, against what durig implements today.
Sources and reasoning: D23.

| Failure mode (source) | durig today | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Silent shared-state corruption (practitioners: most underrated) | impossible — one writer, atomic document revisions, no shared scratchpad | nothing to do |
| Loss of conversation history (MAST FC1) | impossible — conversations are durable rows | nothing to do |
| Orchestration topology | orchestrator-worker (`pm` decomposes, workers claim), not a flat swarm | matches the strongest takeaway |
| Agents lack social technology (Anthropic swarm) | thin substrate exists: constitution, restrictive-by-default edges, append-only transitions | extend, not build |
| No / incomplete verification (MAST FC3) | `complete_work` self-declared; no evidence, no verifier step | near-term 2 |
| Step repetition (FC1, 15.7% — most frequent) | undetected | near-term 4 |
| Unaware of termination conditions (FC1, 12.4%) | no deadline, no attempt cap | near-term 4 |
| Fail to ask for clarification (FC2, 6.8%) | no verb that blocks on a decision; a seat in doubt writes prose | near-term 3 |
| Information withholding (FC2) | role prompt only — a seat cannot retrieve the corpus | near-term 2 |
| Correlated failure / low variance (Anthropic swarm) | 13 seats, 1 distinct model, 1 constitution | near-term 1 |
| Resource stampede (Anthropic swarm) | agents hold no polling tool | keep it that way — near-term 2 |
| Collusion / sabotage (Anthropic swarm) | cooperative by construction; no adversarial objective, no shared market | monitor only |
| Cost, ~15x tokens (Anthropic production) | cheap model by default; offline faux provider for tests | keep — a reason not to default to frontier models |
| Observability (practitioners: "state, coordination, failure isolation, observability") | strong: `watch`, `log`, turn-grouped transcripts, per-seat highlights | nothing to do |
| Reputation / veto rights (practitioners) | edges only; no veto, no quorum, no arbitration | deferred |
| A reason to defer to humans (Anthropic: open problem) | none | mid-term 16, promoted |

## Measuring the research concerns

A gap table says where a rig stands once. The question worth answering is whether
an instance is getting **worse over time**, and whether a configuration change
helped or hurt. That is affordable here for a structural reason: the store already
records the whole interaction — every message, every tool call with its arguments,
every queue transition, every completion — so the concerns are **derived, not
instrumented**. A measure is a read-only query over data we already persist: no new
write path (the single-writer discipline holds), no telemetry, no network.

Proposed: `node cli.mjs metrics [--json] [--window <since>]`, one line per concern,
each labelling its evidence class.

| Concern | Measure | Source | Evidence class |
|---|---|---|---|
| No / incomplete verification (FC3) | share of completions followed by no independent check | queue transitions + per-item actors | direct — and it reads 1.0 *unverified* today, which is the baseline, not a bug |
| Step repetition (FC1) | repeat runs of an identical tool call (name + args) within one conversation | entries | direct |
| Unaware of termination (FC1) | items claimed and never completed, with age; re-claims per item | queue transitions + timestamps | direct |
| Fail to ask for clarification (FC2) | work items addressed to a seat that drew no reply | entries + queue | proxy — question intent is not machine-readable |
| Information withholding (FC2) | completions whose claimer made no retrieval call | entries | direct, and reads 1.0 today because no retrieval tool exists |
| Correlated failure (swarm) | distinct models per seat; author and reviewer sharing one | rig spec + seats doc | config-derived, not a rate |
| Resource stampede (swarm) | tool calls per minute per seat, and the peak | entries | direct |
| Cost (~15x tokens) | tokens per completed item | entries | proxy — entries carry no usage field, so turns / tool calls / prompt size today; exact tokens need the provider seam the live view and generation slots already tap |
| Deferral to humans | escalations raised, and time until answered | queue | direct, reads 0 until the deferral verb lands |
| Collusion / sabotage | — | — | not applicable: no adversarial objective, no scarce shared resource |
| Observability | — | `watch`, `log` | already the strength; a check, not a rate |

**Two honest limits, which the command must print rather than hide.**

1. *A clean measure can mean the capability is missing.* Verification has no
   independent checks today because nothing can check — a measure that reported an
   all-clear would be a lie. Every measure therefore declares its **direction and
   its blind spot**, and none may be read as a pass.
2. *Rates need denominators.* A window over real usage confounds "the rig got
   worse" with "the work changed". Passive windows are cheap and are labelled
   **confounded**; a *drill* — a fixed task set replayed against the rig — is what
   makes two configurations comparable, and D14's blind judge benchmark is the
   existing harness in spirit. A drill needs the faux provider or a small real
   budget.

**The review loop (the point of measuring).** A configuration change is a
hypothesis with a *direction*, recorded **before** the change: what changed, which
measure should move, and which way. Then re-measure. A change whose measure does
not move as predicted is a candidate for reverting — D14's preservation guard,
applied to configuration instead of instructions. Without the predicted direction
written down first, any later movement can be rationalised after the fact.

**Not doing:** no telemetry or egress of measures (which would require a
`security.sec` consult before it ships), no new tables, no measure that needs a new
write path, no dashboards. `metrics` and the `check` audit share the read API with
`watch`/`log`/`status` (near-term 8) — one reader, several views.

## Near-term

0. **Fix the dropped constitution. ✅ done.** `scripts/from-openrig.mjs` emits
   `constitutionInline`, but `cmdUp` read only `spec.constitution`, a file path —
   so the field was dead and a converted rig's constitution never landed.
   Confirmed by reading storage: `tutor-pi.sqlite` held the 411-byte generic
   `constitution.txt`, not the tutor-pi team culture, so all 13 seats ran without
   the rig's own grounding rule while appearing correctly configured. Fixed in
   `cmdUp`, with `demo/constitution.test.mjs` covering inline, file, absent and
   both-set specs, shown to fail against the old behaviour before it passed.
   *Follow-up:* the existing `tutor-pi.sqlite` still holds the generic text, so
   re-running `up rigs/tutor-pi.rig.json` is what applies the team culture — and
   that changes all 13 seats' prompts, so it waits on an operator go-ahead.
1. **`check` — audit a rig against the research gaps, and a hardened starter.**
   Non-interactive (D21): JSON when piped, human on a TTY. Reports per concern —
   independent verifier seat present; author and reviewer on different models;
   constitution states deferral and attempt discipline; every seat can reach the
   seats it must work with (the D16 bug class); a constitution is present at all
   (catches 0); no seat holds a polling tool. Each finding carries a severity and
   the exact fix. Paired with a starter rig whose defaults are the hardened ones.
2. **Verifier model diversity.** All 13 seats resolve to one model while per-seat
   models are already supported (`resolveSeatModel`), so a bias is systemic rather
   than isolated (Anthropic swarm). Give the verifier roles (`qa`, `qa2`) a
   different model family from the authors they check. Configuration-only; the first
   change the measurement in 3 should judge.
3. **The measurement scorecard** (see above): `metrics`, the declared direction and
   blind spot per measure, and a drill task set so two configurations are
   comparable. Build it before the M3 work so the big change has a baseline.
4. **Real seat tools plus verification evidence (M3, and the largest item).** A
   live worker seat reported "no codebase visible … no file system access, no code
   execution" and correctly refused to claim a finished deliverable — the
   constitution working on top of a missing capability. Needs an operator ruling
   on scope: read-only corpus access first, or file edits plus a test runner.
   Whichever is chosen, `complete_work` should carry evidence a verifier can
   re-check, which is what turns MAST FC3 from a norm into a mechanism. Seats must
   get **no polling tool** in the process.
5. **A deferral verb.** Today a seat that needs a decision can only emit prose.
   Add a way to raise a question that blocks the item and hands it to the seat or
   human who can answer — the "reason to defer to humans" the swarm paper leaves
   open, and the mechanism our own pair-review and Ledger norms currently assume.
6. **Termination and attempt semantics.** No deadline, no attempt cap, no
   repetition detection: the two most common MAST design failures (step repetition
   15.7%, unaware of termination 12.4%) are both unaddressed. Subsumes the
   block/park/wake-after semantics raised against Core_Ideas layer 7.
7. **Extract the view model and peer navigation graph (D21).** Pure functions:
   turns, collapse state, and "which seat sent to / received from this seat",
   derivable from queue items' `from`/`to` and the Router tools. Unblocks both
   interactive asks without committing to a screen model.
8. **One shared read API.** `watch`, `log`, `status`, `check` and `metrics` each
   re-implement seat, health and queue reading today; that duplication is the real
   refactor smell, ahead of any formatting concern. It now has five consumers, so
   the seam is forced rather than speculative.
9. **Repeat-call tolerant tools** — a second `claim_work` in one invocation errors
   with `Cannot use a settled overlay` (RESEARCH.md R2). Tools should return
   current state on repeat calls; models retry naturally.
10. **`log --follow` consistency** — it prints the backfill as one block and each
    later entry on its own, so column alignment and turn grouping differ between
    them. Small, self-contained.

## Mid-term

11. **Pods design decision** — OpenRig parity question deferred twice:
    namespace-scoped queues vs a flat queue with pod tags. Needs an operator ruling
    before implementation (the converter currently drops pods with a warning).
12. **Workflow task type** — SOP-style phases enqueueing queue items and waiting on
    DONE notices, built on PD's durable task graph (Core_Ideas layer 7).
13. **Seat handover on context exhaustion** — PD has compaction; the OpenRig
    handover-packet flow does not exist yet.
14. **Measurement history** — persisting scorecard snapshots per config revision so
    the before/after comparison in the review loop is a lookup rather than a
    re-run. Deliberately not in the first cut: it adds a write path, which is why
    it waits until passive windows have proven useful.
15. **Drill harness** — the fixed task set plus faux-provider replay, if the
    benchmark half of 3 turns out to need more than a script.
16. **Human approval gate hook** — PD hooks can block tool calls pending an
    operator decision. Promoted by D23: the swarm paper names deferral to humans as
    an open problem, and this is the mechanism that answers it.
17. **Interactive client (M4)** — only after (7) and (8). If chosen, prefer
    `@earendil-works/pi-tui` (already a dependency of `pi-coding-agent@1.1.0`, so
    it is in-stack) over adopting a new framework; the browser/SSE client is the
    cheaper option if the interaction set stays small.

## Explicitly deferred (with reasons)

- **Reputation, veto and quorum arbitration** — the practitioner fix for
  "verbose non-decisions", but durig's seats have no adversarial objective and no
  competing claims over scarce resources, so the mechanism would police a failure
  mode the rig cannot currently produce (D23). Revisit if seats are ever given
  conflicting objectives.
- **Flat peer swarms** — the topology the evidence is most consistent about
  avoiding; durably wrong for this rig, not merely deferred.
- Textual interaction in `cli.mjs` itself — would break the JSON contract the
  seats drive (D21).
- Alternate-screen TUI with in-place collapsing — forces mouse reporting and full
  repaint, losing scrollback and pipes, and is the worst-supported combination
  with tmux (RESEARCH.md, "Formatting a transcript").
- Terminal multiplexing as a dependency — no per-seat terminal exists to attach to
  (D22).
- Real push instead of polling — SQLite has no cross-process notification; Honker
  and tailite are catalogued in RESEARCH.md but Windows support is unverified.
- Constitutional-evolution search, Big-Five trait injection, FIPA-ACL performatives,
  Contract-Net auctions, dynamic persona generation, blackboard architecture —
  evaluated against Core_Ideas.txt; rationales in DECISIONS.md.
