# durig — roadmap

Ordered by operator value; each item names its motivating finding.
State as of **2026-10-10**: work is paused at the end of the viewing/formatting
milestone. `docs/STATUS.md` is the handoff record; `docs/DECISIONS.md` holds the
reasoning, and D23 records how this roadmap was re-ordered by the research.

## Milestones

- **M1 — Rig runs and routes. ✅ done.** Queue semantics, org edges, Router at
  harness open, seat prompts, real-model e2e (D3, D4, D5, D16).
- **M2 — Operator can see the rig. ✅ done.** `watch`/`log` human views, live
  stream on `send`, turn-grouped transcripts with timestamps, wrong-database
  guardrail (D18, D19, D20).
- **M3 — Seats can do work, and the rig verifies it. ⏳ next.** Two things that
  are one work item (D23): seats hold only the four queue tools, so they cannot
  read a corpus or run a check; and `complete_work` is self-declared, with no
  evidence attached and no verifier step. A verification the rig cannot run is a
  promise, not a check.
- **M4 — Interactive client over the same store.** Deferred by decision (D21),
  not by accident. Blocked on choosing TUI vs browser, which needs an operator
  ruling.

## Gap analysis vs the research (2026-10-10)

Failure modes named by the MAST taxonomy, Anthropic's production and swarm
research, and the practitioner consensus, against what durig implements today.
Sources and reasoning: D23.

| Failure mode (source) | durig today | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Silent shared-state corruption (practitioners: most underrated) | impossible — one writer, atomic document revisions, no shared scratchpad | nothing to do |
| Loss of conversation history (MAST FC1) | impossible — conversations are durable rows | nothing to do |
| Orchestration topology | orchestrator-worker (`pm` decomposes, workers claim), not a flat swarm | matches the strongest takeaway |
| Agents lack social technology (Anthropic swarm) | thin substrate exists: constitution, restrictive-by-default edges, append-only transitions | extend, not build |
| No / incomplete verification (MAST FC3) | `complete_work` self-declared; no evidence, no verifier step | near-term 2 |
| Step repetition (FC1, 15.7% — most frequent) | undetected | near-term 4 |
| Unaware of termination conditions (FC1, 12.4%) | no deadline, no attempt cap | near-term 4 |
| Fail to ask for clarification (FC2, 6.8%) | no verb that blocks on a decision; a seat in doubt writes prose | near-term 3 |
| Information withholding (FC2) | role prompt only — a seat cannot retrieve the corpus | near-term 2 |
| Correlated failure / low variance (Anthropic swarm) | 13 seats, 1 distinct model, 1 constitution | near-term 1 |
| Resource stampede (Anthropic swarm) | agents hold no polling tool | keep it that way — near-term 2 |
| Collusion / sabotage (Anthropic swarm) | cooperative by construction; no adversarial objective, no shared market | monitor only |
| Cost, ~15x tokens (Anthropic production) | cheap model by default; offline faux provider for tests | keep — a reason not to default to frontier models |
| Observability (practitioners: "state, coordination, failure isolation, observability") | strong: `watch`, `log`, turn-grouped transcripts, per-seat highlights | nothing to do |
| Reputation / veto rights (practitioners) | edges only; no veto, no quorum, no arbitration | deferred |
| A reason to defer to humans (Anthropic: open problem) | none | mid-term 5, promoted |

## Near-term

1. **Verifier model diversity.** All 13 seats resolve to one model while per-seat
   models are already supported (`resolveSeatModel`), so a bias is systemic rather
   than isolated (Anthropic swarm). Give the verifier roles (`qa`, `qa2`) a
   different model family from the authors they check. Configuration change; do
   this first because it is the only gap closed without new code.
2. **Real seat tools plus verification evidence (M3, and the largest item).** A
   live worker seat reported "no codebase visible … no file system access, no code
   execution" and correctly refused to claim a finished deliverable — the
   constitution working on top of a missing capability. Needs an operator ruling
   on scope: read-only corpus access first, or file edits plus a test runner.
   Whichever is chosen, `complete_work` should carry evidence a verifier can
   re-check, which is what turns MAST FC3 from a norm into a mechanism. Seats must
   get **no polling tool** in the process.
3. **A deferral verb.** Today a seat that needs a decision can only emit prose.
   Add a way to raise a question that blocks the item and hands it to the seat or
   human who can answer — the "reason to defer to humans" the swarm paper leaves
   open, and the mechanism our own pair-review and Ledger norms currently assume.
4. **Termination and attempt semantics.** No deadline, no attempt cap, no
   repetition detection: the two most common MAST design failures (step repetition
   15.7%, unaware of termination 12.4%) are both unaddressed. Also subsumes the
   mid-term block/park/wake item.
5. **Extract the view model and peer navigation graph (D21).** Pure functions:
   turns, collapse state, and "which seat sent to / received from this seat",
   derivable from queue items' `from`/`to` and the Router tools. Unblocks both
   interactive asks without committing to a screen model.
6. **One shared read API.** `watch`, `log` and `status` each re-implement seat and
   health reading today; that duplication is the real refactor smell, ahead of any
   formatting concern.
7. **Repeat-call tolerant tools** — a second `claim_work` in one invocation errors
   with `Cannot use a settled overlay` (RESEARCH.md R2). Tools should return
   current state on repeat calls; models retry naturally.
8. **`log --follow` consistency** — it prints the backfill as one block and each
   later entry on its own, so column alignment and turn grouping differ between
   them. Small, self-contained.

## Mid-term

9. **Pods design decision** — OpenRig parity question deferred twice:
   namespace-scoped queues vs a flat queue with pod tags. Needs an operator ruling
   before implementation (the converter currently drops pods with a warning).
10. **Workflow task type** — SOP-style phases enqueueing queue items and waiting on
    DONE notices, built on PD's durable task graph (Core_Ideas layer 7).
11. **Seat handover on context exhaustion** — PD has compaction; the OpenRig
    handover-packet flow does not exist yet.
12. **Human approval gate hook** — PD hooks can block tool calls pending an
    operator decision. Promoted by D23: the swarm paper names deferral to humans as
    an open problem, and this is the mechanism that answers it.
13. **Interactive client (M4)** — only after (5) and (6). If chosen, prefer
    `@earendil-works/pi-tui` (already a dependency of `pi-coding-agent@1.1.0`, so
    it is in-stack) over adopting a new framework; the browser/SSE client is the
    cheaper option if the interaction set stays small.

## Explicitly deferred (with reasons)

- **Reputation, veto and quorum arbitration** — the practitioner fix for
  "verbose non-decisions", but durig's seats have no adversarial objective and no
  competing claims over scarce resources, so the mechanism would police a failure
  mode the rig cannot currently produce (D23). Revisit if seats are ever given
  conflicting objectives.
- **Flat peer swarms** — the topology the evidence is most consistent about
  avoiding; durably wrong for this rig, not merely deferred.
- Textual interaction in `cli.mjs` itself — would break the JSON contract the
  seats drive (D21).
- Alternate-screen TUI with in-place collapsing — forces mouse reporting and full
  repaint, losing scrollback and pipes, and is the worst-supported combination
  with tmux (RESEARCH.md, "Formatting a transcript").
- Terminal multiplexing as a dependency — no per-seat terminal exists to attach to
  (D22).
- Real push instead of polling — SQLite has no cross-process notification; Honker
  and tailite are catalogued in RESEARCH.md but Windows support is unverified.
- Constitutional-evolution search, Big-Five trait injection, FIPA-ACL performatives,
  Contract-Net auctions, dynamic persona generation, blackboard architecture —
  evaluated against Core_Ideas.txt; rationales in DECISIONS.md.
