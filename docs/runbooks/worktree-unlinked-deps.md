# A worktree provisioned with UNLINKED dependencies

## When to use

Either of these:

- `prepare_workspace` returned a result containing `DEPENDENCY NOT LINKED in this worktree: the
  sync-pi --link step FAILED (...)`. The rest of the result is normal: the worktree exists and your
  tools point at it.
- You did not see that line, but a suite run in a fresh worktree fails demos that pass in the seat
  root (typically the five `tui-durable-*` demos), and nothing you changed explains it.

## Impact

Your worktree resolves the `@earendil-works/pi-durable` version pinned in `package-lock.json`
instead of the built `vendor/pi-main` tree the seat root links to. The two dependency sets are not
the same, so **a suite verdict from this tree is not comparable with the seat root's** - not "slightly
worse", but a different measurement. If you report a red set without saying which tree and which
dependency set produced it, nobody can use your verdict.

Work itself is not blocked: the worktree runs, and code that does not touch pi-durable behaves
identically.

## Preconditions

Read-only. Nothing here needs the broker stopped.

## Diagnose (read-only)

The state is on the provisioning record, not in a log line. If you still have the `prepare_workspace`
result, read it. Otherwise compare the two trees directly:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('<worktree>/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-durable/package.json').version)"
node -e "console.log(require('<seat-root>/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-durable/package.json').version)"
ls <worktree>/vendor/pi-main/packages/durable/dist/index.js 2>/dev/null || echo "vendor/pi-main NOT BUILT here"
```

If the versions differ, or `vendor/pi-main` is missing, this is the state. The missing build tree is
the cause: `--link` has nothing to point at, so it exits 1 with `nothing built yet; run --sync before
--link`, and provisioning continues on the lockfile by design.

## Do

1. If you need parity with the seat root (a verifier measuring the landing, or any suite verdict you
   will report), build the pinned tree in YOUR worktree, then re-prepare:

   ```bash
   node scripts/sync-pi.mjs --sync
   ```

   Then call `prepare_workspace` again for the same item. A reused worktree is only re-checked when
   its `node_modules` is missing, so to force a re-link delete `node_modules` in the worktree first
   (`node scripts/sync-pi.mjs --link` on its own is the direct form).

2. If you do NOT need parity, do nothing - and say so in your result: "suite run in the worktree,
   pi-durable from the lockfile, not the seat root". A stated dependency set is a usable verdict; an
   unstated one is not.

3. Do not treat the delta as noise. Measured 2026-10-20: the same commit reported 3 red in the seat
   root and 7 after a worktree-local `npm ci`. Two of those were REAL content defects, one was an
   environment guard and five were dependency-version artefacts. A pass that calls the whole delta
   "environmental" will also excuse the real ones.

## Verify

The behaviour is pinned by a demo that provisions a fresh worktree with no `vendor/pi-main` and
asserts the outcome is an explicit UNLINKED state, not a warning:

```bash
node demo/worktree-deps-link.test.mjs; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expect `exit=0` and a `PASS` line. If it is red, a failed link has gone back to being silent - stop
and route it to impl.

## If it fails

If `sync-pi --sync` itself fails, the cause is upstream of this runbook: it fetches and builds the
pinned pi commit, so it needs network and a working `npm`. Report the JSON it prints (`{"ok":false,
"error":...}`) rather than retrying blindly. If `npm ci` is what fails, that is a different runbook:
[prepare-workspace-etarget.md](prepare-workspace-etarget.md).

## Escalate to

impl (the provisioning path). The operator, if the pinned build cannot be produced on this host.

## Evidence

impl-item-3821. Before the fix, on main: two `console.warn` lines reading only `Command failed:` (the
step's JSON on stdout was dropped, so even the warning had no cause) and an install record with no
dependency field at all. Last verified 2026-10-20 by impl.
