## NEXT SESSION — START HERE

**Current item: #506 (impl) — make the broker's per-task worktree guard NOT fail closed on a dirty
shared tree.** #506 is next in impl's queue (position 2, behind the claimed U4 #483 and #502), so the
running broker will drive it without re-prioritisation. **The interactive client series is COMPLETE**
(U1–U7 #480–#486 all `done`); #487 (deferrals + re-sequence) is `done`; #488/#489/#490 (upstream sync
+ partner-check) are `done`. Live bookkeeping: **#491** (designer's 5 UX follow-ups — impl #617 is
BLOCKED on a pm routing ruling) and **#502** (cli status seat last-activity, claimed).

Exact next commands:
`DURIG_SEAT_ROOT=C:/Users/Alex/dsh-Projects/pi-opendurig DURIG_DB=./selfdev.sqlite node cli.mjs status`,
`… node cli.mjs log impl`; stop with `… node cli.mjs serve --stop`.

**State at this refresh (2026-10-16, delegate session):** resident broker **pid 17424**
(`01:12:41Z`; healthy — `PASS 1` in ~1 min) with the **degeneration guard armed**. Store is
single-writer. Only untracked scratch remains (`#612`/devtools owns `pi-main.pin.bak`; the other three
scratch files are already gone). **#571 is moot** — `src/viewmodel.mjs` is fixed. NOTE: committing
in-flight work makes a seat log "another seat committed my work" — expected under the shared-tree
entanglement (#506), not an error.

**Accomplishments this delegate session (all LOCAL; operator holds push):**

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `3b429dc` | fix(broker) #400 — `brokerAlive` treats EPERM as alive |
| `e937b31` | feat(up) #402 — model-change reset seam in `cmdUp` |
| `5c300dc` | docs truth-up + broker socket review |
| `484a571` | feat(broker) — lifecycle audit `START`/`EXIT reason` in `<db>.broker.log` |
| `ae96445` | feat(guard) — auto-reset a seat whose run goes degenerate (F29) |
| `0ecf9cf` | D63/D64 + landed the seat's stranded D54–D62 |
| `c6eaef3` | feat(tui) U1–U5 — interactive client (`#480`–`#484`) |
| `11edfb3` | chore(commit-model) #474/#475 — worktree-scoped explicit-path commits |
| `a2ea013`,`832bc21`,`d24c9e6`,`e1bc4f2` | pointer refreshes |

Also recovered a **wedged broker** (pid 35604 — no `PASS` for 42 min, `serve --stop` failed twice;
force-stopped and restarted; root cause in `.spike/delegate/serve.err`: the #506 dirty-tree guard +
a genlock slot `held by pid undefined`). Suite **78/78** on the committed tree; **no build, no lint**.

Known blockers: **#506** (the dirty-tree worktree guard bites live; the working-tree files are seats'
in-progress work — **DO NOT discard**); cooperative `serve --stop` can take ~13-min passes but exits
(a wedged pass cannot be stopped cooperatively — see the recovery note above).
**Docs landed:** D63 (broker lifecycle audit) + D64 (degeneration guard) are in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
(commit `0ecf9cf`), which also landed the seat's stranded D54–D62 (D62 has a text corruption to fix).
**#506 is next in impl's queue** (position 2, right behind the claimed U4 #483 / #502).

_Historical (superseded): the #480-era notes below were written for the 2026-10-15 handoff._

**Future work (candidate items — not yet queued):**
- **Broker intent-inbox** — deliver intent to a seat WITHOUT stopping the broker (a file the broker
drains each pass, sibling to `.broker.stop`). Today `cmdSend` has no broker guard, so routing needs a
`serve --stop`, which interrupts in-flight work.
- **Reset at WORK-ITEM boundaries only** (deferred mitigation 3): clear a seat's context when it
finishes a work item — explicitly NOT finer item boundaries yet.
- **Mid-run cut** (optional): the degeneration guard resets BETWEEN runs; a provider-level turn cap
would cut a single runaway run mid-flight. (Bounded runs are mitigated; this is the residual gap.)
- **Worktree leak + recursion (NEW, observed 2026-10-16):** the broker's per-task worktrees
  (`item-1/`, `item-2/` in the repo root) are **not gitignored** and **not cleaned up**, so they
  pollute `git status`; and because the #506 fix “forks the visible state”, each new worktree
  **copies the existing untracked worktrees** (`item-2` nests a full `item-1/`) — recursive growth.
  Needs a lifecycle fix (ignore the worktree root + clean up on completion).
- **`docs/DECISIONS.md` entries** — LANDED (`0ecf9cf`): D63 (broker audit) + D64 (degeneration guard),
plus the seat's stranded D54–D62. Remaining: fix D62's text corruption (`headless \tenderTui/Frame`).

**Earlier this session: `pi-rebase` recovery (C) re-verified COMPLETE — no action taken.**
Evidence: `git diff --diff-filter=A main origin/pi-rebase -- . ':(exclude).spike'` is empty (no
tracked file on the snapshot is absent from `main`); `demo/pitui.test.mjs` is present on `main`;
the local branch is already deleted; `docs/BRANCH-AUDIT-2026-10-14.md` records the recovery as
executed. Do NOT re-apply the snapshot (D48: adapt onto `main`, never restore a whole snapshot).

**Then (next queued item): #480 (U1) — build the `durig ui` driver (queue id #480; TOP PRIORITY; UNBLOCKED).**
The rest of the interactive-client series is **#481–#487 (U2–U7)**. U1 is the missing piece between
`src/tui/client.mjs` (a headless renderer) and the operator: a separate entrypoint that owns raw mode
+ key handling + the poll loop and paints `renderTui` frames (`cli.mjs` stays non-interactive, D21;
read-only, D11/D40).

Exact next command (drive the selfdev team; the seat root is the live tree):

`DURIG_SEAT_ROOT=C:/Users/Alex/dsh-Projects/pi-opendurig DURIG_DB=./selfdev.sqlite node cli.mjs send impl --body-file <body>`

and have impl `claim_work({ itemId: 480 })` FIRST — a plain `run` makes impl take its oldest queued row
(impl has ~36). Bounded alternative: `DURIG_SEAT_ROOT=C:/Users/Alex/dsh-Projects/pi-opendurig DURIG_DB=./selfdev.sqlite node cli.mjs run --max-duration 300`.

Known blocker: the store is **single-writer** — never run two `send`/`run`/`serve` at once. No
genlock/broker is held at handoff.

**Session state (2026-10-15 delegate handoff — do not re-derive):**
- **#473 (worktree lifecycle wiring) DONE and qa-VERIFIED.** qa's #477 verdict = PASS (68/68,
  `node --check` clean). qa's caveats: the demo does NOT exercise the live `drivePass` claim path
  (reviewed only), and 5 pre-existing silent-return catches remain (`src/broker.mjs:317,375`;
  `src/worktree.mjs:104,216,394`).
- **Model swap (D51):** the five former Qwen seats (`impl`, `qa`, `advocate`, `auditor`, `designer`)
  now run `zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash`; `rig.selfdev.json` edited + `up --refresh` applied. No context reset
  was written — the operator may `reset <seat>` the five.
- **TUI re-prioritized** by pm into **#480–#487 (U1–U7)**: U1 driver, U2 team-wide multi-pane of
  actively-generating seats (live generation state, NOT queue depth), U3 in-place tool-call block,
  U4 pi-style tool bg/fg, U5 thinking parity, U6 re-open the bogus C4 verification, U7 poll-first vs
  Level 2 to lead/operator. pm also cleared the #188/#193 deferrals (#487).
- **Lower priority, NOT registered** (operator deferred): `watch`/`seatActivity` shows green "working"
  for ANY `claimed` row, so impl's **6 stale claims (#287, #289, #290, #291, #294, #335)** read as active.
  Two-part fix: resolve those rows (impl completes/cancels; pm cancels its five; #287 is lead's), and
  make green require a live lease/in-flight submission.

Then, in order:
1. **#473** — wire worktrees into claim/completion: on claim, create the item's worktree+branch and
   point the working seat's cwd/`DURIG_SEAT_ROOT` at it; on completion, commit ONLY the item's files
   on its branch, release the lock, `git worktree remove`. **#474 is GATED on #473** — do NOT put
   "commit before finishing" into any seat's instructions until the wiring is proven, or seats will
   commit from the shared tree and stage each other's work. #475 documents the model.
2. **GROOM THE QUEUE** — it is churning: **135 non-terminal** (impl 65, pm 44, qa 15). Most are
   `DONE`-report rows pm must process and artifacts qa must verify. `peek_queue(all=true)` is now
   uncapped (#433), so pm can enumerate; use `cancel_work` (D47) for stale/duplicate rows.
3. **qa verification backlog** — #391/#393/#395/#449 (commit policy), #456/#458/#460/#462/#464/#466
   (broker + help + coordinator), #451 (TUI C3). qa's own DONE reports back to impl (#410–#448) also
   need settling.
4. **TUI** — C3 (#404) built, C4 (#405) reported "done but blocked" by qa; the corrected C4
   verification is owed. Designer UX follow-ups #437 (C6, done via #428), #439 (C7 defaults),
   #440 (C8 error messages), #442 (C9 rig auto-discovery), #444 (C10 meta-defaults). Advocate #407.
5. **#400** broker wake-path verification; **#402** #148 half-2 seam (cmdUp --refresh); **#415**
   verify the concurrency statement against code.
6. **Docs gate items #390/#398/#401/#468–#471** — much of this was written by the delegate this
   session (FEATURES/STATUS/SELFDEV), but the items are still open; have scribe verify and close them
   rather than redo the work. `scribe` is `last_run_failed` (wedged on #468) — `reset scribe` first.

## What landed this session (all LOCAL — unpushed; operator holds push)

`main` is at the handoff commit; the six code/doc commits through **`ddd9c49`** are now on
**`origin/main`** (pushed externally — NOT by the delegate), and only the handoff commit is local.
Tree clean, suite **68/68**.

| Commit | Content |
|---|---|
| `80ac4d5` | **#330 Phase 2** — per-task worktree lifecycle + Windows Job-Object reaping |
| `5b21763` | **#384–#386/D50** — developer commit authority; commits scoped to the item |
| `5ecddd1` | **#428–#433** — broker bounds/cooperative-stop/log/concurrent attribution; `--help`; uncapped `peek_queue` |
| `e28a653` | **TUI C3** client (`src/tui/client.mjs`) + read-layer proofs |
| `82a89f2` | **docs** truth-up (FEATURES/STATUS/DECISIONS/SELFDEV/WORKFLOWS/SELF-ADMIN/NEXT) |
| `ddd9c49` | **fix(test)** — broker demos no longer swallow cleanup errors |

Note: `git grep -n "claimWorktree" -- cli.mjs src/` returns only `src/worktree.mjs` — the wiring is
the whole point of #473.

## Pitfalls that slowed this session down (read before driving)

- **`run`/`serve --max-duration` is now a real bound (#429), but it was not** — a `--max-duration 300`
  broker ran >15 min. If you see that again, it is the defect, not your invocation.
- **`stop <seat>` aborts the run but leaves the `send` parent process alive.** `resume` finds nothing.
  After a `stop`, check for a lingering `node cli.mjs send ...` and `taskkill /F /PID` it. (Recorded
  lesson.)
- **A forced kill leaves a STALE genlock slot** (`.genlock.N`, dead pid) and the next driver may warn
  `held by pid <dead>` / `pid undefined` and stall. Check `selfdev.sqlite.genlock.*`; remove the ones
  whose pid is dead (they are lock files with no work).
- **A stop can also leave `cli.mjs serve --help`-style stray processes.** `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process`
  filtered on `cli.mjs (send|run|serve)` is the fast check.
- **Seats thrash on hard native-interop work** (the P2-6 Job Object cost ~2 h across two abort/reset
  cycles). Give a bounded instruction; if the seat ignores it, `stop` + `reset <seat> <handoff>` and
  re-scope — do not let it run.
- **The broker/driver order is oldest-first per seat.** New priority items sit behind a 60-item
  backlog, so `claim_work({itemId})` via a direct `send <seat> --body-file` is the way to prioritize;
  grooming is the structural fix.
- **Two writers, precisely.** One *store/harness* writer per DB (two `run`/`send` drivers race on the
  entry id, F24; `run`/`up` are not retried). Concurrency is `serve` + `DURIG_MAX_CONCURRENT_SEATS`.
  Per-task worktrees will make concurrent *editing* safe once #473 lands.
- **Full suite > 120 s** so a single tool call times out; loop `demo/*.test.mjs` per file with a long
  timeout, or background it. Baseline is now **68/68** (the old `starter.test.mjs` CRLF failure is FIXED).
- **`edit` needs exact indentation and line endings.** The demo tests use 2-space indent; `src/rig.mjs`
  and others are CRLF. When a match misses, run `sed -n 'A,Bp' file | cat -A` before retrying.
- **Empty `catch {}` violates "errors are not swallowed"** and the warden flags it. Reporting it
  surfaced two real bugs in the broker demos (a scoped `broker` ReferenceError and `require` in ESM).
- **Seats clean up badly:** scratch appeared as `docs/WORKFLOWS.md.tmp`, `test.log`, and
  `undefined.broker.log`. The last one is a real bug: `src/broker.mjs` `brokerLogPath(dbPath)`
  returns `` `${dbPath}.broker.log` ``, so a falsy `dbPath` writes `undefined.broker.log` (it
  regenerates on a suite run). Guard against a falsy `dbPath` (no-op or throw). `git status` before
  every commit.
- **qa sometimes marks an item done while reporting it blocked** (#336/C4). Check the result text.

## Workspace state for the next agent

- **No writers running.** No `serve`/`broker.json`, no `genlock` slots. Confirm with the process check.
- **Tree is clean**, `main` at `ddd9c49`, unpushed.
- **Backups under `.spike/delegate/`**: `recovery-WIP.patch`, `storewrite-WIP.mjs`,
  `p2-6-scratch/` (the Job-Object attempts), `scratch-backup/` (the removed scratch), and the
  intent bodies used this session. `.spike/` is gitignored.
- **Env**: run with `DURIG_DB=./selfdev.sqlite` and `DURIG_SEAT_ROOT=C:/Users/Alex/dsh-Projects/pi-opendurig`.
  `durig.config.json` sets `DURIG_MAX_CONCURRENT_SEATS=4` (local, gitignored) for concurrency testing.
- **Native Windows only** — never `wsl`, `docker`, `docker-compose`.

## Traps (standing — do not repeat)

- **NEVER run `git stash`/`reset`/`checkout`/`restore`/`clean` from a seat** — not with a trailing
  `;`/`&&`/`|`. The guard catches the anchored forms (#329) but the denylist is only a backstop.
- **Only a write-side process wakes seats** (`send`/`run`/`serve`); viewers never do (D11).
- **Coordinators (pm/lead) cannot read/write files** (#156) — route file tasks to a file-capable seat;
  `peek_queue(all=true)` now mitigates the enumeration half.
- **A seat can wander or degenerate** (F29) — `reset <seat> <handoff>` then re-drive.

## Where main is

`main` is at the handoff commit; **`origin/main` = `ddd9c49`** — the six commits through the broker-fix
commit were pushed externally (NOT by the delegate), so only the handoff commit is local. The
recovered tranche (#307–#312) and the TUI read layer (`789ead6`) are already committed.
Untracked/ignored: `.spike/`, `AGENTS.md` (modified + committed this session), `pi-warden.md`,
`vendor/`.
